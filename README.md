# Line_Follower_Robot
Tiva board is used


Tiva-C Launchpad was used to create a Line Follower Robot (LFR) (TM4C123). A coloured track is maintained by the LFR. With the aid of a customised PID controller, it maintains its position on the track. PWM is used to adjust the motor speeds after reading information from the sensor. Additionally, it uses a PID controller to calculate and correct mistake.
